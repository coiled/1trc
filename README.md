# One Trillion Row Challenge

Inspired by Gunnar Morling's [one billion row challenge](https://github.com/gunnarmorling/1brc), we thought we'd take things one step further and start the one trillion row challenge (1TRC).

We describe the 1TRC, dataset, and running the challenge with Dask on Coiled in [this blog post](https://docs.coiled.io/blog/1trc.html).

## The Challenge

Your task is to use any tool(s) youâ€™d like to calculate the min, mean, and max temperature per weather station, sorted alphabetically. The data is stored in Parquet on S3 in the `s3://coiled-datasets-rp/1trc` requester-pays bucket in AWS region `us-east-1`. Each file is 10 million rows and there are 100,000 files. For an extra challenge, you could also [generate the data yourself](#Data-Generation).

### How To Participate

Open an issue in this repository with your submission and enough details for someone else to be able to run your implementation. This includes things like:

- Hardware
- Runtime
- Reproducible code snippet

There is no prize and everyone is a winner. Really, the idea is to solicit ideas and generate discussion.

## Data Generation

You can generate the dataset yourself using the [data generation script](generate_data.py), adapted from [Jacob Tomlinson's 1BRC data generation script](https://github.com/gunnarmorling/1brc/discussions/487). We've also hosted the dataset in a requester pays S3 bucket `s3://coiled-datasets-rp/1trc` in `us-east-1`. 

It draws a random sample of weather stations and normally distributed temperatures drawn from the mean for each station based on the values in [lookup.csv](lookup.csv).
